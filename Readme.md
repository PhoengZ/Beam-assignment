# Beam assignment
## Assignment 1
let n is number of input, h is max number of each input, w is sum of inputs
1. time complexity is O(n + w*h)
2. space complexity is O(n+ w*h)

## Assignment 2
let L is length of path in command and n is number of file in folder
1. time complexity is O(nlog(n)) 
2. space complexity is O(L + n)

## Assignment 3
1. time complexity is O(log(n))
2. space complexity is O(1)
